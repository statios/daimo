Why Daimo?

What to do is sometimes just to set a list of things to do today, or sometimes to do for a very long time in life. But those long-term projects can eventually come together and do small things. 

In order to achieve a long-term project like getting a job, you have to do a lot of small projects like getting a license or writing a resume. 

The process of achieving this plan is that we have to manage projects both large and small, organically at the same time. 

Daimo was created by this need. I classified what I needed to do for the project as yearly, montly, weekly, and daily, and let you see at a glance. 

With daimo, you no longer have to carry all your monthly planners, weekly planners, and daily planners.
